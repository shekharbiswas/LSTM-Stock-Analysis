# Problem statement

Stock price prediction involves forecasting the future price of a company's stock using historical data. 
Accurate predictions can inform trading strategies and investment decisions, aiming to maximize returns or minimize risk.



## High Volatile Stocks

- LSTM model excels at capturing patterns in complex data.
- Therefore, LSTM can be better utilised for understanding high volatile instruments.
- High volatily also includes noise ( challenge to overcome)
- Volatility Measurement

### Identify stocks which are volatile enough and provide the measurement
- We can check Standard deviation and Beta measurements
- Find a threshold for choosing the stocks.
- 4 stocks from different segment ( need to research a bit )
- Tech, Finance, Industrial Prod, FMCG
